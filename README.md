# PyBer Analysis
Module 5, PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview 
The CEO, V. Isualize, has given me the assignment to produce a DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type for the whole year, and a more in depth multiple line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type for the first third of the year (from January 1st to the end of April).

## Results
![summary_data_frame](https://github.com/chefcramer/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/pyber%20summary%20DF.PNG)
- As you can see in this DataFrame, the rural cities have the smallest number of individual rides as well as the smallest number of drivers, but the largest average fare rate and the largest fare per driver. There are 125 total rides, with only 78 total drivers, this is an almost 2 to 1 ratio, and this yields a much higher average fare per driver. We can also infer that the rides taken in rural cities are longer in duration than in urban and suburban citites, yielding a higher average average fare per ride. However, since this city type has, by far, the smallest number of rides, it also produces the smallest number of total fares, $4,327.93.
- The suburban data set shows that the data for total rides, total drivers, and total fares is almost exactly 5 times the values of the rural data set. However both the average fare per ride and per driver are both less than the rural data set. There are 625 total rides, with 490 dirvers, this is much closer to a 6 to 5 ratio, but there are still more rides needed than individual drivers to provide them. This yields a substantionally higher average fare per driver than the data in urban cities. We can also infer that the trip duration is not as long as in the rural cities, but still longer than the average in urban cities. This type of city has produced almost $20,000 in total fares ($19,356.33), which is the most effective per total driver count in this data set
- The urban data set shows that the data for total rides and total drivers is the highest out of all the types of cities, but the average fare per ride and per driver is also the lowest. There are 1625 total rides with 2405 total drivers, which will yield a much lower average fare per driver (slightly less than 1/3 of the average for rural drivers). We can also infer that the urban rides are the shortest in duration, yielding the lowest average fare per ride. This type of city produced the larges total fare count at $39.854.38. However, the total number of drivers is almost 5 times the number of drivers for suburban cities, and the total fares is only twice as large.

- The data shown in this graph shows the same results as shown in the results above, the urban cities are the largest performers, and the rural are the smallest, with the suburban cities falling in the middle. However the weekly data points show the fluctuations in the fares over time. The data shows spikes in fares in the middle of February (most likey Valentines Day), and the middle/end of March (most likely St Patricks Day), with the sharpest spikes being in the Urban and Suburban city types. 

## Summary
Based on this analysis, I can make 3 recommendations to improve the disparities between the different types of cities. 
- Firstly, it seems that the Urban cities are "overstaffed". The urban cities have the highest number of total fares but also the higest ratio of drivers to rides (almost 2 drivers per 1 ride). There are many more drivers than fares, resulting in smaller average fares per individual drivers. The data also indicates that the rides takes in urban cities seem to be "short hops" rather than longer trips, the smallest average fare per ride in the data set. If the number of drivers is decreased, the overall fare for each driver would increase. 
- Secondly, the rural cities have the highest average fare per trip and average fare per driver, however I do not recommend that more dirvers be added to rural cities. There simply does not seem to be a demand for many more drivers. The rides take in the rural cities seem to be longer trips (rural cities are much more "spread out" than urban cities), resulting in the highest average fare per ride in the data set.
- Finally, the focus on advertizing should be placed on Suburban cities to increase the number of rides, and the corresponding increase in drivers to handle the increase in rides. The suburban cities seem to be the "money makers"; The average fare per ride indicates a decently long trip, as well as the corresponding line on the graph shows that there is much less sharp fluctuation week to week than urban cities. The suburban cities had $19,356.33 in total fares, which is half of what the urban cites had in total fares ($39,854.38), with only 1/5th of the total drivers (490 to 2405).
