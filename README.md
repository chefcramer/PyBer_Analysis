# PyBer Analysis
Module 5, PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview 
The CEO, V. Isualize, has given me the assignment to produce a DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type for the whole year, and a more in depth multiple line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type for the first third of the year (from January 1st to the end of April).

## Results
![summary_data_frame](https://github.com/chefcramer/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/pyber%20summary%20DF.PNG)
- As you can see in this DataFrame, the rural cities have the smallest number of individual rides as well as the smallest number of drivers, but the largest average fare rate and the largest fare per driver. There are 125 total rides, with only 78 total drivers, this is an almost 2 to 1 ratio, and this yields a much higher average fare per driver. We can also infer that the rides taken in rural cities are longer in duration than in urban and suburban citites, yielding a higher average average fare per ride. However, since this city type has, by far, the smallest number of rides, it also produces the smallest number of total fares, $4,327.93.
- The suburban data set shows that the data for total rides, total drivers, and total fares is almost exactly 5 times the values of the rural data set. However both the average fare per ride and per driver are both less than the rural data set. There are 625 total rides, with 490 dirvers, this is much closer to a 6 to 5 ratio, but there are still more rides needed than individual drivers to provide them. This yields a substantionally higher average fare per driver than the data in urban cities. We can also infer that the trip duration is not as long as in the rural cities, but but still longer than the average in urban cities. This type of city has produced almost $20,000 in total fares ($19,356.33), which is the most effective per total driver count in this data set
- The urban data set shows that the data for total rides and total drivers is the highest out of all the types of cities, but the average fare per ride and per driver is also the lowest. There are 1625 total rides with 2405 total drivers, which will yield a much lower average fare per driver (slightly less than 1/3 of the average for rural drivers). We can also infer that the urban rides are the shortest in duration, yielding the lowest average fare per ride.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)


Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
